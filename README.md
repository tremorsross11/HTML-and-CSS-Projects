# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
A repository for all of my code written using HTML and/or CSS.<br>
The Basic-HTML-and-CSS folder are an assortment of projects I worked on while learning how to use HTML and CSS.<br>
The basic-HTML-and-Javascript1 directory have some more projects where I also start to utilize animations on websites.<br>
The Bootstrap_4 directory is where I utilized premade code from bootstrap to aid my web development.
